Module "RxBuf"     (component RingBufferUInt8)
   - RxBuf_Put -Puts a new element into the buffer
   - RxBuf_Get -Removes an element from the buffer
   - RxBuf_NofElements -Returns the actual number of elements in the buffer.
   - RxBuf_NofFreeElements -Returns the actual number of free elements/space in the buffer.
   - RxBuf_Init -Initializes the data structure

Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation.
