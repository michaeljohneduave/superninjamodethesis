Module "AS1"       (component FRDM_KL25Z_UART)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts vectors, 
                etc.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation.
   - AS1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters.
   - AS1_GetReceivedDataNum -Returns the number of received characters in the receive buffer.
   - AS1_GetTxCompleteStatus -Returns whether the transmitter has transmitted all characters and there are no other characters 
                in the transmitter's HW FIFO or the shift register. The status flag is accumulated, after calling this method 
                the status is returned and cleared (set to "false" state). This method is available only if a peripheral 
                supports this feature.
   - AS1_Main -This method is available only in the polling mode (Interrupt service/event = 'no'). If interrupt service is 
                disabled this method replaces the interrupt handler. This method should be called if Receive/SendBlock was 
                invoked before in order to run the reception/transmission. The end of the receiving/transmitting is indicated 
                by OnBlockSent or OnBlockReceived event.
